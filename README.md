Welcome to the front lines of the digital cat-and-mouse game between AI image generation and detection. This repository isn't just a collection of scripts, it's an interactive laboratory packaged in a Google Colab notebook. It's designed for anyone curious about peering under the hood of AI image detectors to understand their mechanisms, identify their blind spots, and learn how subtle image perturbations can render a synthetic image indistinguishable from a real one—at least to an algorithm.

This project is built for educational and research purposes, catering to students, security researchers, digital forensics experts, and adversarial ML practitioners.

## The Philosophy

To build more robust and reliable systems, we must first understand how they can fail. The techniques in this notebook are a form of "red-teaming" for AI detectors. By systematically applying perturbations and analyzing the outcomes, we can gain invaluable insights into the features these models rely on. The goal isn't to empower malicious actors, but to arm defenders with the knowledge they need to build the next generation of resilient detection models.

## Technical AI Image Detector

Before diving into the "how," let's understand the "what." AI detectors are trained to spot the subtle, often imperceptible "digital fingerprints" left behind by generative models. These fingerprints can exist in several domains:

1.  **The Spatial Domain** 
This is about pixel patterns. Detectors might look for unnaturally smooth textures (a common trait of GANs), perfectly repeating patterns, or inconsistencies in lighting and shadows that a real camera and physical light wouldn't produce.

2.  **The Frequency Domain** 
This is where many detectors find their "smoking gun." When you break an image down into its constituent frequencies using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), AI-generated images often exhibit tell-tale signs:
    *   **High-Frequency Attenuation:** A lack of the fine, crisp noise and detail present in real photos.
    *   **Spectral Peaks:** Unnatural spikes at certain frequencies, often related to the upsampling layers (like transposed convolutions) in the generator's architecture, which can create subtle grid-like artifacts.

3.  **The Statistical Domain (The math behind the pixels)**
This involves analyzing the distribution of pixel values, the relationships between neighboring pixels (gradients), or coefficients from transforms like the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform, used in JPEGs). Natural images have a certain statistical "rhythm," and AI models often struggle to replicate it perfectly.

The techniques in this notebook are designed to attack these very fingerprints—either by erasing them or by camouflaging them with characteristics of natural, camera-captured images.

## Our Toolkit

Each method implemented in the notebook is a tool designed for a specific purpose. Here’s a breakdown of what they do and why they work.

### 1. Noise Injection
-   **The Core Idea:** Real photos are never perfectly clean. They contain noise from the camera's sensor. AI images, by contrast, are often mathematically pristine. This lack of noise is a huge red flag for a detector. We can exploit this by adding a realistic layer of noise.
-   **How It's Implemented:** We don't just throw random noise at the image. The implementation is nuanced:
    -   **Luminance-Adaptive Gaussian Noise:** The amount of Gaussian noise added isn't uniform. It's scaled based on the image's average brightness (`mean_luma`). This mimics how noise is more visible in the darker regions of a real photograph.
    -   **Sparse Salt-and-Pepper Noise:** A tiny fraction of pixels are randomly flipped to pure black or white. This simulates "dead" or "hot" pixels on a sensor, adding another layer of physical realism.
-   **The Intended Effect:** To mask the AI's clean signature under a plausible blanket of camera-like noise, thereby confusing detectors that rely on noise-level analysis.

### 2. Pixel Perturbation
-   **The Core Idea:** This is a simplified, "blind" version of a classic adversarial attack. Instead of calculating a model's gradient, we estimate the image's own gradient (i.e., its edges) and push pixels slightly along those lines.
-   **How It's Implemented:**
    1.  A **Sobel operator** is used to find the direction of sharpest change for each pixel.
    2.  A small perturbation (`epsilon * sign(gradient)`) is added, subtly sharpening or blurring micro-contrasts.
    3.  Crucially, we perform post-processing: a **Bilateral Filter** smooths the changes without destroying edges, and a **Color Statistics Match** ensures the image's overall color palette and contrast remain unchanged.
-   **The Intended Effect:** To disrupt the micro-texture and local gradient patterns that a detector might have learned are characteristic of a specific AI architecture.

### 3. Camera Simulation
-   **The Core Idea:** This is one of the most powerful techniques. Instead of just adding noise, we simulate the entire physical process of a picture passing through a cheap, imperfect camera lens and sensor. This introduces a cascade of complex, organic distortions.
-   **How It's Implemented:** This is a multi-stage pipeline:
    -   **Lens Distortion:** Applies a radial distortion model (`k1`, `k2`) to simulate the "barrel" or "pincushion" effect of a non-perfect lens.
    -   **Chromatic Aberration:** Slightly shifts the Red and Blue color channels outwards from the center. This mimics a lens's failure to focus all colors at the same point, creating subtle color fringes on high-contrast edges.
    -   **Signal-Dependent ISO Noise:** Simulates the noise pattern of a camera sensor at a high ISO setting, where brighter pixels are noisier than dark ones.
    -   **Optical Softening & Sharpening:** A combination of a slight Gaussian blur (to mimic lens softness) followed by an unsharp mask creates a realistic sharpening effect common in digital cameras.
-   **The Intended Effect:** To fundamentally alter the image's geometric and color-channel correlations, effectively "overwriting" the original AI fingerprints with plausible optical ones.

### 4. FFT Smoothing (Frequency Low-pass Filter)
-   **The Core Idea:** The sledgehammer approach. Some generative models create unnatural, high-frequency artifacts. This method simply sands them off.
-   **How It's Implemented:** We transform the image into the frequency domain using FFT and multiply it by a mask that preserves low frequencies (the core shapes and colors) while aggressively cutting off high frequencies (the fine details and noise). The `cutoff` and `rolloff` parameters control how gentle this cut is.
-   **The Intended Effect:** To remove high-frequency artifacts that are dead giveaways to frequency-based detectors, at the cost of some image softness.

### 5. FFT Matching
-   **The Core Idea:** The sculptor's chisel. Instead of just removing frequencies, we attempt to remold the image's entire frequency profile to match that of a typical natural image. Natural images often exhibit a `1/f` power spectrum, meaning their power decreases as frequency increases.
-   **How It's Implemented:**
    1.  A synthetic "target spectrum" is created that follows this natural `1/f` distribution.
    2.  The image's actual frequency amplitude is calculated.
    3.  A scaling factor is computed to push the image's amplitude towards the target. The `strength` parameter controls how aggressively we reshape it.
    4.  The new, reshaped amplitudes are combined with the image's original phase informat

2.  **Open in Colab:** The easiest way is to click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of this README.
3.  **Run the Setup Cell:** The first code cell (`@title Upload & Setup`) is your launchpad. It installs nothing but imports all necessary libraries and defines a suite of helper functions. Run it, and it will prompt you to upload an image.
4.  **Execute One by One:** Step through the notebook, running each technique's cell. You'll get instant visual feedback, comparing the original to the processed image, along with image quality metrics (PSNR and SSIM) to quantify how much the image was altered.
5.  **Analyze and Export:**
    *   The **"SAVE AND VIZUAL"** section provides a summary plot of all transformations.
    *   The **"Export & Download"** cell is the grand finale. It saves every result as a high-quality PNG, embeds processing parameters into the metadata, runs a "Final Pipeline" that combines all techniques, and packages everything into a `.zip` file for you to download.
    *   The **"Tecnical Vizualization"** cell is for the true enthusiast. It generates a dashboard of advanced analytics (FFT spectrums, power spectral density plots, DCT heatmaps) that let you *see* the statistical impact of the transformations.
